This project contains script and configuration files for setting up a Hadoop Cluster for development and testing. It can be setup:
- as a single-node cluster (or a stand-alone)
- as a multi-node cluster (to be added)

The project was created and tested with
- Hadoop v1.2.1 [download] (http://apache.mesi.com.ar/hadoop/common/hadoop-1.2.1/hadoop-1.2.1-bin.tar.gz)
- Java SE v1.6.x or better
- Linux/CentOS v6.5 or better
